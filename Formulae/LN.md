# Logarithm
The function we all know and love, which is a `mirror image` of `exp` around the line `y = x`\
A.K.A they are inverse functions of each other!

## Linear inner function
- [] Now, let's start with the first few derivatives of `f(x) = ln(x)`:
```
f₀: ln(x)
f₁: 1/x
f₂: -1/x²
f₃: 2/x³
```

As you can see it is just the derivatives of 1/x after the first derivative\
So, why not just derivate that first, the n derivatives of f(x) = 1/x.\
We will do it in [Quotient formula](QUO.md)
